# Cryptography Algorithms

These implementations should not be used in practice. They were implemented solely for educational and enjoyment purposes. Please do not use them in an application.

The code is written in a library style and originally was part of the [rrmhearts/Kata](https://github.com/rrmhearts/Kata) repository. As the several various cryptography-related files grew, I found they needed their own home.

* [Caesar Cipher](./crypto_algs/caesar_cipher.py)
* [Davies Meyer](./crypto_algs/davies_meyer.py)
* [Merkle Damgard](./crypto_algs/merkle_damgard.py)
* [Mersenne Twister](./crypto_algs/mersenne_twister.py)
* [Not DES](./crypto_algs/notDES.py) (an approximation of DES symmetric encryption)
* [RSA](./crypto_algs/rsa.py)
* [Sieve of Eratosthenes](./crypto_algs/utils.py)
* [String rotation utilities](./crypto_algs/rotate_string.py)
